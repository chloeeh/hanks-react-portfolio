# wk2 - Create Portfolio

## Description
The purpose of this project is to create a new and improved portfolio using React. viewport-responsive webpage that displays the author's portfolio. When the user clicks on any of the navigation links in the header, the webpage will bring the user to the selected section.

The project _Acceptance Criteria_ and screenshots of the webpage in different sizes (to show it is a responsive design) are depicted below:
